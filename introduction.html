	<p><b>C language</b> <br>
# In 1988, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) had formalized the C language.
C was invented to write UNIX operating system.
C is a successor of 'Basic Combined Programming Language' (BCPL) called B language.
Linux OS, PHP, and MySQL are written in C.
<br>
C has been written in assembly language.
In the beginning, C was used for developing system applications, e.g. :<br>
1. Database Systems<br>
2. Language Interpreters<br>
3. Compilers and Assemblers<br>
4. Operating Systems<br>
5. Network Drivers<br>
6. Word Processors<br>
# One of the early programming languages<br># Still, the best programming language to learn quickly.<br>
# C language is reliable, simple, and easy to use.<br>
# C language is a structured language.<br>
# Modern programming concepts are based on C.<br>
# It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.<br>
# Universities preferred to add C programming in their courseware.<br>
C is a robust language with a rich set of built-in functions and operators.
Programs written in C are efficient and fast.
C is highly portable; programs once written in C can be run on other machines with minor or no modification.
C is a collection of C library functions; we can also create our function and add it to the C library.
C is easily extensible.
C is the building block for many other programming languages.
Programs written in C are highly portable.
Several standard functions are there (like in-built) that can be used to develop programs.
C programs are collections of C library functions, and it's also easy to add functions to the C library.
The modular structure makes code debugging, maintenance, and testing easier.
C does not provide Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
There are no concepts of Namespace in C.
C does not provide binding or wrapping up of data in a single unit.
C does not provide Constructor and Destructor.</p>
<p><b>C++</b><br># C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
<br>
# C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).</p>
<p><b>Java language</b><br># Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.<br> Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
<br>
# Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.</p>
<p><b>Python</b><br># Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
<br>
# Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
<br>
# Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

<p><b>HTML and CSS</b><br># The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
<br>
# Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
<br>
# HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br># CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files>
